# BMSIP scRNAseq Analysis and Benchmarking
Analysis of scRNA-seq samples using Seurat and benchmarking of various industry standard data integration tools.

The `docs` folder has the poster which was presented summarising the work done over the period of the internship, as well as 2 presentations during BMSIP meetings.

## Deliverables:
- [x] Analysing and compiling results for 5 scRNASeq mouse samples using Seurat.
- [x] Analysing and compiling results for 10 scRNASeq monkey samples using Seurat.
- [x] Running and optimising novel graph-based method for scRNASeq (scGND) [[ 1 ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.28.577667v1.abstract)].
- [x] Running tools in R and python for comparative study with the new tool actively being developed in the lab. Current tools which have been shortlisted include: MNN, fastMNN, scmap, limma, scMerge, LIGER, scGEN, MMD-ResNet, ZINB-WaVE.
